* Results for goals, pledges and backers for plays researched in Edinburgh
* Statistics of successful and failed campaigns for plays in the United States 
* Distribution comparison of campaign goals and total pledges for plays in the United States. 

Based on the research conducted, the prime time for launching kickstarter campaigns is between April-June. Kickstarter theater campaigns in the United States and Great Britain have higher rate of success than failure. The median pledge is slightly higher than the median goal of $3000. The average pledge is slightly higher than the average goal of $5000 suggesting the goal could be raised slightly on new campaigns.

# Challenge 1: An Analysis of Kickstarter Theater Campaigns

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of the project is to provide an analysis of kickstarter campaigns in the category of theaters conducted during the years of 2009-2017. The analysis reviews outcome goals and launch dates for campaigns during this period.

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to determine the outcome of theater campaigns by launch date and review funding goals achieved specififcally for plays.  

## Analysis and Challenges
Dataset was pulled on all kickstarter campaigns conducted between 2009-2017. The dataset includes nine categories in the arts field. The nine categories included forty-one sub-categories. Filtering the data for outcomes by year in the theater category reduced the number of campaigns reviewed to 1369. Data was further filtered to analyze goal amounts for the sub-category of plays. Outcomes included in the anaysis are successful, failed and canceled. Goal campaign range from less than $1000 to more than $50000. A limitation in this analysis is that it does not include a comparison of the goal and pledged amount. The limitation prevents future campaigns from understanding how close failed goals came to being successful.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Of the 1369 theater campaigns conducted worldwide during the years of 2009-2017, 839 or 61% were successful in meeting or exceeding the intended goal. Of the total 839 successful theater campaigns, 25% of those were conducted during the months of May and June, indicating those months as the best time to conduct kickstarter campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the 1047 plays included in the outcomes chart, plays with goals under $5000 are more likely to meet or exceed the intended goal, with the greatest rate of success for campaigns in the $1000-4999 range. The below chart shows that of the 694 successful campaigns for plays conducted between 2009-2017, 76% of those with goals under $5000 met or exceeded the intended goal. Campaigns in the $5000-9999 range were successful about 55% of the time during the same time period.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The analysis conducted does not account for why a campaign met or exceeded its goal, for example type of plays (i.e. mystery, drama, cultural) is not accounted for in the dataset. This metric could be useful to new campaigns in forcasting the likelihood of success of the campaign based on the type of plays that backers are likely to fund. A second challenge with the analysis is that 68% of successful campaigns for plays in the "less than $1000" range were for $500 or less. This skew the results of successful campaigns to the right. Outliers should be taken into consideration when reviewing the analysis. 

## Results
- Based on the analysis conducted on the outcomes based on launch date, campaigns conducted in May and June are more likely to be successful. The data also shows that kickstarter thearter campaigns are not likely to be canceled as none of the campaigns launched between 2009-2017 were canceled. 
 
- Based on the results of the "Outcomes Based on Goals" data chart of the 169 kickstarter campaigns for plays with goals in the $5000-9999 range 93 successfully met or exceeded the intended goal. This accounts for about 55% of the campaigns and suggests that this is a solid target range for new campaigns. 

- Limitations to this dataset include any metrics on why a kickstarter campaign succeeds or fails. Further analysis is needed to help prospective campaigns in understanding the elememts of a successful campaign such as type of play and marketing used to promote the campaign. 

- Other possible tables and graphs could include a box and whisker chart to determine outliers. A bar chart to review campaigns by country may be helpful to understanding where successful campaigns are held.
